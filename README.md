# Unsupervised-Learning-Implementation

This repository contains the coursework completed for the 'Methods of Data Science' module under the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London. The full code will be updated on Mar 29th.

The primary objective of this project was to gain an understanding of the mathematical properties behind various unnsupervised learning techniques, including:

1. Implement Principla Component Analysis (PCA) and Nonnegative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) from scratch to perform image denoising on dataset that is corrupted by noises.
