# Unsupervised-Learning-Implementation

This repository contains the coursework completed for the 'Methods of Data Science' module under the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London.

The primary objective of this project was to gain an understanding of the mathematical properties behind various unsupervised learning techniques, and re-produce some of the tools in TensorFlow and NetworkX packages from scratch. 

Brief outline:

1. Neural Networks: Initialised codes from scratch to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and dropout method by using stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation.

2. Dimensionality Reudction: Implemented Principla Component Analysis (PCA) and Nonnegative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) from scratch to perform image denoising on dataset corrupted by noises.

3. Mixture Models: Created Gaussian Mixture Models class structure and implemented Expectation-maximisation algorithm to cluster data.

4. Implemented from scratch the K-means clustering algorithm, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Homogeneity score.

5. Conducted a graph-based analysis of gene co-expression using various network analysis techniques.
